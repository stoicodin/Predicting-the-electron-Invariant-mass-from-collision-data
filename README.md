# WIS22
This project has been done by the author during Wolfram India School 2022 under the mentor JuliÃ¡n Laverde. This notebook has been done solely in the Wolfram Language predicting the electron Invariant mass from collision data.

## Abstract
The project aims at exploring various features of the dielectron collision using rigorous data analysis tools. The dataset consisting 100,000 dielectron events in the invariant mass range 2-110 GeV is also used to train the neural network. The neural network is used on test dataset to predict the invariant mass of the electron.

## Future plan and Ideas
My future plans involves further use of databases generated by other type of decays like proton-proton(pp), hadronic collision, etc. This method can also be deployed even for complex decay processes and calculating different parameters of the collision. The idea can also be extended to collision types other than 2->2.
